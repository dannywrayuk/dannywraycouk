# A little about me

Hey, I'm Danny. I'm currently a software engineer at Capital One. I'm passionate about web development and all things javascript.

Before I started my journey into software engineering I was a physics student. I studied theoretical physics at the University of Nottingham and graduated in 2020 with a masters degree. My thesis was in cosmology, which you can read [here](/projects/scalar-fields-in-cosmology).

I first joined Capital One as an intern in 2019 and I've been hooked on web development since then. I accepted an offer to join them on their graduate scheme, where I could rotate job roles around the company. After spending some time in quality engineering, product design and java services, I'm happy to be back where I feel I belong as a web developer.

## Hobbies and interests

I absolutely love boba tea, bubble tea, whatever you like to call it. Nottingham has so many great places too. I really enjoy trying new shops and drinks ðŸ§‹ I also play the guitar every now and again ðŸŽ¸
