<label>Einstein's experiment that showcased the particle nature of light.</label>
<hr/>

After Planck discovered that energy was quantised into chunks he was quite sceptical, justifiably, since nowhere else in
nature had this kind of behaviour been observed. It also goes against everything we experience in our daily lives. For
instance, when observing a ball slow down we see its velocity decrease smoothly. However, in the quantum version of this
system the ball would slow down in discontinuous steps as the energy decreased instantaneously from one energy level to
the next. Obviously, one solution is that the ball is a macroscopic object and the steps are incredibly small, so the
deceleration appears to be smooth. However, when talking about individual particles this doesn't apply as the gaps
between energy levels are large, relative to the size of a particle. It wasn't until 1905, when Einstein described his
Photoelectric effect, that the first piece of evidence for these energy chunks would emerge.
The laws that governed light did so under the assumption that light was and electromagnetic wave. Waves have the
property that their energy is spread out throughout space. If this was the case, then how could light possibly come in
the chunks that Planck observed? This behaviour is much more reminiscent of particles.

Einstein took a block of metal that contained electrons. When supplied with energy it is possible to remove some of
these electrons from the metal, such as in a circuit. It makes logical sense then that by shining a light onto a metal
that the energy transfer should also be able to remove electrons.

However, if the light shone onto the metal is low frequency then no electrons would be removed regardless of how intense
the light source was. When high frequency light was shone onto the same metal, many electrons would be removed even if
the light source was very dim. This effect cannot be accounted for by the wave model of light.

Einstein considered the chunks of energy that Planck discovered as physical particles of light. He viewed them as small
wave packets and gave them the name 'photons'. His reasoning is as follows; If an electron requires an energy of $W$ to
be ejected then only photons with an energy $E \geq W$ will be able to cause an electron to eject, regardless of how
many photons are emitted. If we now include the dependence of energy on frequency derived by Planck then the behaviour
of the metal becomes very easy to explain.

If the energy of one of these chunks (that we now call photons) is $E=hf$, then the photoelectric effect can be formally
written as
$$
K_{max}=hf-W \tag{1.2.1}
$$
$W$ is usually known as the work function but since is has units of energy can be written in terms of a threshold
frequency $f_0$
$$
K_{max}=h(f-f_0) \tag{1.2.2}
$$
<label>**Photoelectric Effect 1905**<label>

From this form of the effect and realising that kinetic energy is strictly positive we can conclude that for the effect
to occur $f>f_0$. This is in perfect alignment with the frequency dependent emission of electrons displayed by metal.

This connection made by Einstein was revolutionary and it's this research for which Einstein received his Nobel prize.
It has its problems, though. Light is a very well-established wave phenomenon and exhibits properties not possible by a
classical particle. For instance, a simple experiment that showcases this wave behaviour is the double slit experiment.
When a wave passes through a double slit the two wave fronts that appear from each slit then interact with each other
and cause an interference pattern on the detector screen. In the photon model this doesn't make sense. If one photon at
a time was to be shot at the double slit, the photon can only go through one of the two slits unlike the wave. This
means that there is nothing for the photon to interact with and there shouldn't be an interference pattern, but there
is! Initially, as single photons pass through the slit there is a seemingly random distribution of points on the
detector. As more and more particles are let through the pattern appears. In the classical areas of high intensity there
is a higher probability of a single particle landing there. This is what produces the pattern in the particle model.

*In this video clip you can see the distribution of single particles traveling through the double slit and how they are more probable to land in the classically intense regions, giving rise to the interference pattern.*


It's here that the theory starts to become a little hard to understand. You've probably heard many times that nobody
truly understands Quantum Mechanics. While that is true, the mathematics is very well understood. It's strange
contradictions like this to follow that is meant when people say that nobody understands.

There is evidence that photons have wave nature and now evidence that photons have a particle like behaviour. So, what
are they? If they were normal particles, then to form an interference pattern on the screen the photons would have to
somehow go through both slits and interfere with themselves, so they surely can't be particles. We will see later that
this so called 'Wave Particle Duality' has a perfectly sound mathematical description.

Louis De Broglie suggested that if photons were particles and waves at the same time then there should be a link between
the fundamental properties of waves and particles, wavelength and momentum. By using scattering particles and using the
conservation of momentum the relationship was determined as
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} \tag{1.2.3}
$$
This relationship is very interesting. Particles do not have a wavelenth, but they do have momentum. This equation gives
us a result for the wavelegth of a particle or the momentum of a wave.

As for the question of "what are they?", well, we just don't know. Humans evolved on large scales where quantum
mechanical behaviours had no impact on how well a species would survive. It's unsurprising that these phenomena taking
place at the sub atomic level don't make sense to our monkey brains.
