For one of my university modules I was tasked with investigating N-Body simulations. I decided to go down the route of large scale structures with high particle numbers. The particle-mesh method is inaccurate at small length scales but is incredibly efficient at large length scales, which was perfect form my use case. To read more you can view my project report here
