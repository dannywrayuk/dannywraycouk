        This site has been through many iterations. It started out as a custom webserver running on an old laptop under my bed, and slowly evolved into this site here. My original goal was to host a website for as cheap as possible, so an old laptop wasn't a bad idea, but today it runs on AWS.

    <Description>
        While at University I started typesetting my lecture notes as a revision tool. They're not great and they're not finished, but hopefully they'll be useful to someone somewhere. I've started off writing up my notes on quantum mechanics and once finished will start writing up on other areas of physics.
