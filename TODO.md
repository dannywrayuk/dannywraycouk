# MAJOR:

* ### Add Blog Project and More + Search
    - [ ] Add Blog
        This will probably borrow many features from Physics.
    - [ ] Add Projects
        Likely the same as blog just different content.
    - [ ] Add More
        Single page of misc links etc
    - [ ] Once these pages are added the search bar should have the ability to search all the content

# MINOR:

* ### Standardise CSS
    * The css of the website is awful, I'd like to standardise it all.

* ### Dark Theme
    * Once the css is easier to manage dark theme would be cool.

* ### Review ResponsiveElement/Divider
    * They might be a bit useless and cause clutter.

* ### Redirector
    * dannywray.co.uk/x should check x and redirect to another page if specified in a table.


# PATCH:

* ### Stretching on iOS
    * Need to review the images on iOS devices for the blog section on homepage.
 
* ### Add github to follow me section.

* ### environments/App is unnecessary
    * This components can be added to the entry folder and Atomic Design structure improved.
